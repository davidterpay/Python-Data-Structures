This class will demonstrate some of the functionality of a heap. The heap I 
will build is going to be a min heap where the largest data point is on top 
and the tree nodes value's decrease as you move down the tree. This most
nearly just means that the most important data point is going to be stored 
in the root. I utilize the binarytree class from Binary_Tree to build the heap.
You can check out the code and documentation in the Binary_Tree folder in 
this repository.
