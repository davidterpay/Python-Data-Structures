# Python-Data-Structures
This is an on going project of mine - to code every major data structure in python. I will also add a C++ version sometime in the future. Currently at 4,330 lines of code. You can find demonstrations of every data structure in the folders corresponding to each data structure. In addition, I made sure to comment every function to ensure that users understand the algorithm behind each function.

### So far I have :

Heaps

AVL Trees

KDTrees -- K Dimensional Trees

BTrees

Disjoint Sets (in progress)

Graphs (in progress)

Binary Trees

Linked Lists

Stacks

Queues

### I still want to add :

Hashing

Skip Lists

Tries (prefix tree)

Huffman Encoding
