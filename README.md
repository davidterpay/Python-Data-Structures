# Python-Data-Structures
This is an on going project of mine - to code every major data structure in python. I will also add a C++ version sometime in the future. Over 5500+ lines of code and documentation. You can find jupyter notebook demos of every data structure in the folders.

Full Udemy Data Structures + Algorithms course is currently being modified to be more comprehensive. This repo still can still teach through jupyter notebook. Updates to the course will soon be posted here.

### So far I have :

Heaps

AVL Trees

KDTrees -- K Dimensional Trees

BTrees

Disjoint Sets

Graphs

Binary Trees

Linked Lists

Stacks

Queues

### I still want to add :

Hashing

Skip Lists

Tries (prefix tree)

Huffman Encoding
