# Python-Data-Structures
This is an on going project of mine - to code every major data structure in python. I will also add a C++ version sometime in the future. Over 5300+ lines of code and documentation. You can find jupyter notebook demos of every data structure in the folders.

Full Data Structures + Algorithms course will be available on Udemy by Novemeber 1st.
