# Python-Data-Structures
This is an on going project of mine - to code every major data structure in python. I will also add a C++ version sometime in the future.

### So far I have :

Linked Lists

Stacks

Queues

Binary Trees

Heaps

AVL Trees (Very similart to Red Black tree; kinda similar to splay tree)

KDTrees (in progress)

### I still want to add :

BTrees

Disjoint Sets

Graphs

Hashing of some sort

Skip List

Trie (prefix tree)

Huffman Encoding (Maybe in its own folder)
